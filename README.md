I'm Paula Hemsi an avid self-learner and software engeneering student at [école 42](https://www.42.fr/). I spent the last years of my live around stages and backstages, until the pandemic arrived in Brasil. In 2020 I discovered programming and I've been hacking away at computers since then. 

I'm passionate about logic since childhood, and love to program 'cause it's a challenging, creative activity that exercises a wide array of mental skills. 

I'm also deeply interested in profound talks about human beeing and knowing other cultures, it would be remarkably interesting to live in diferent localitys, tasting diferent cuisine, knowing others views and philosophies.
