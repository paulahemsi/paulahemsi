Hi there! I'm Paula Hemsi, an avid self-learner and software engineering student at [école 42](https://www.42.fr/). I've been passionate about logic since childhood, but spent the last years of my life around stages and backstages, until the pandemic arrived in Brasil. In 2020 programming arrives in my life and I'm tottaly in love with it since then. 

I'm also deeply interested in knowing other cultures, it would be marvelous to live in different localities, tasting different cuisines, knowing new landscapes and philosophies.
